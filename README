Sudoku solver using reduction to boolean satisfiability (CNF) and MiniSat to solve written in Haskell.

The only dependency in addition to MiniSat is the Data.List.Split, install with cabal:
$ cabal install Split

A MiniSat binary, version 2.2.0, built on 64-bit linux (ubuntu 10.4) is included.
You can replace this with your own. See http://minisat.se/.

An example puzzle file is included in "puzzles", the format should be self explanatory.
This contains 50 sudoku puzzles - it is from http://projecteuler.net/.

i.e. $./sudoku puzzles
